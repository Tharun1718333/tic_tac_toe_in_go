# tic_tac_toe_in_go

Hi Folks, This is a tic tac toe game that is written in golang <br />
This can be implemented in CLI <br />

Please refer the design.pdf for info on the classes,functions and interfaces <br />

We can have 3 types of players here :- 
 Human Player   :- Need to give input from the terminal <br />
 Random Player  :- Implements a Random Move <br />
 Optimal player :- Implements optimal Moves with the worst case possibility as draw <br />
 
 # How to implement
 Fork the project and make sure all the .go files are in one folder <br />
 on the implementation.go file change the type of players you pass into the Player stack and run the program
 
 # Possible scenarios
 Humal vs Human <br />
 Human vs Random <br />
 Human vs optimal <br />
 optimal vs Random <br />
 Random vs Random <br />
 optimal vs optimal <br />
